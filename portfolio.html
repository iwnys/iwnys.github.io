                    <p>I have two female friends who live with me throughout the study season named Zati and Ashwa. One day, Zati invited me and Ashwa to her brother's party which is located in Marang, Terengganu. We spent the night there until the ceremony was over. Me and Ashwa had time helping zati's family like decorating the couch, making souvenirs to give to the guests who attended. The next day, zati's family invited me and ashwa out to eat at Nasi Dagang Atas Toll as a sign of gratitude to us for helping zati's family. Zati's family is very kind. They ordered various types of food to serve to us. When we finished eating, we asked to go back to Besut because the lecture season was about to start.</p><!-- comment -->
